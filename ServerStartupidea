Rpg server


Server spawn
I can’t build. I would like to plan a spawn with elv (I can help build -ken)
spawn must contain:
basic quest for players to learn how to use quest plugin
Npc’s chatting, offering advice to new players
Town-theme
A place where players can teleport to ‘zones’ (quest areas)
an area for shop

This. Yes.-ken
The first zone
Literally can be any build
forest.. camp… town… etc etc
Must be easy-ish, will contain spawners
Basic quests, cool rewards 
By the end of the zone players should have a decent set of armor with supplies 
repeatable quests that give food/resources
Expansions
Expansions come out with zones, new zones with new quests
Can happen monthly or whenever they’re able to come out
MCMMO <3
Custom skills plugin, allows players to ‘get good’ at skills and be rewarded for training them
SECRET CHESTS LOCATED AROUND THE WORLD GIVING A SMALL BOOST IN EACH SKILL, or just providing special loot. -Ken
Coreprotect
Essential. Mandatory. No questions asked.
we need it cola.
Citizens
Custom NPC’s that can walk, talk, or give quests
adds an atmosphere where the player does not think he is alone
Main focus of RPG server. 
Quests
Coincides with Citizens
Make quests in-game or with notepad
Compatible with a lot of plugins
Weekly/maybe monthly big quest? -ken
MythicMobs
Create mobs with strengths - they can be easy or hard
ex. zombie can hit for 2 hearts or 20
Custom loot tables - can drop certain loot
yes
MythicBosses 
Same idea as mythic mobs (LITERALLY THE SAME THING-Ken)
Abilities - fireworks, fireballs, lightning, etc. 
Spawn rates - can spawn every X chunks or every X time
Special loot tables - % chance at drops
more yes
MythicDrops
13,000,000,000,000 different items
Custom loot, custom stats, custom drop rates, etc.
we can configure to take out certain things (identity tomes)
infinity yes
Phatloots
Customizable weapons with stats
ex. Strength increase, hp increase, speed increase…
Can be added in quests, mythicmobs, mythicbosses, etc.
Mobdisguise
Basically, donor rewards.
Pets (?)
Same deal - donor rewards.
Multiverse-portals
Teleport players specific places - specific zones
not mandatory, but it’s a good plugin
Maybe have requirements for each zone? Skill level reqs to move on so that a newbie can’t just jump into the last zone. -Ken

To-Do List:
Plan out spawn
Plan out first zone
Configure all the plugins - download files and configure them
Teach staff how to use plugins
start basic quests 
make a price list for all vanilla objects - eventually implemented into a shop
perms
Set up custom mobs
Set up 1 or 2 custom easy bosses
Set up mythicDrops
Plan out very first zone


Things we can do if we have extra time
set up races/classes (MAYBE) [This. Highly recommend this. Adds more to the experience, but would have to have well thought out races/classes with equally thought out backstories and yada yada-Ken]
Extra bosses and mobs
Another zone with more quests
Time based ranks? (one week = upgrade, month after that = upgrade, etc. Each rank has more perms than the last, but nothing too OP. Maybe some kits, more /homes) -Ken
Keep inventory? Maybe lose some money when they die? -Ken
